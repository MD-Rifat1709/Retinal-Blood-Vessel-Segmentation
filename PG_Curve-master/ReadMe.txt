Matlab code for computing and visualization: Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall, ROC, 
Accuracy, F-Measure etc. for Classification.

The package runs well at Matlab(Version:R2010b) for Windows. However, it may
report some errors at old version matlab, e.g., "no function 'assert'" or others.
You can update yout Matlab or you can find the missing functions(.m files).


Just run main.m, then you can follow the method in main.m do do your own
work.
