# Retinal-Blood-Vessel-Segmentation
Evaluation of the segmented vascular structures of the retina of our eye obtained through fundus photography using Machine learning techniques. Two open-source databases of the retinal images (DRIVE and STARE) are used. K - Means Clustering Algorithm is used for the segmentation of the retinal images. MATLAB r2020b environment was employed for feature extraction and image segmentation. The accuracy of the segmentation is evaluated for both the database as well as the algorithms.  A simple GUI was developed for convinience of evaluation. The future work in this project deals with improving the accuracy of the segmented vessels and using them for classification of vessels into arteries and veins, and also for identification of various diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy, Stroke, Glaucoma etc. A more interactive, highlyautomated graphical user interface (GUI) may also be developed for user convenience and the software may be made compatible for various devices in the future.
